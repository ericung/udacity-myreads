# MyReads Project

This is the project for the MyReads project. The homepage has a list of books categorized in three shelves: currently reading, wanting to read, and read. The user can move the book into different shelves by clicking the drop down next to the thumbnail of the book which will instantly move the book to the proper shelf. The book can be removed by selecting none on the dropdown menu. In order to add books, the user can click on the plus sign on the bottom-righthand corner. This will direct the user to the search page. On the search page, the user must type some word(s) into the search bar. A list of books will appear if a valid search term is enter or being entered. The user can then select where the book can be moved when clicking on the dropdown menu next to the thumbnail. If it a shelf is selected, it will appear on the main page. Clicking on the back button on the search bar will redirect to the main page.

## TL;DR

Users can keep track of the status of books they read and search for more books via the search function.

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Github Source

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
